This is just a prototype website because this is my first time doing a backend.
Run this project with flask

## Getting Started

1. **Install virtual environment (venv):**

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    # On macOS/Linux
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
